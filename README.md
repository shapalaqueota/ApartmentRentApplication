# ApartmentRentApp
The project is a web application for apartment rentals, organized using Java and the Spring Framework. Technologies presented in the code: Java and Spring Framework:

The project is developed in the Java programming language using the Spring Framework to create a web application. You can see the use of annotations @Controller, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, which is typical for Spring MVC. Spring Security:

The project probably uses Spring Security to authenticate and authorize users. Spring Data JPA:

The code contains repositories (UserRepository2, BookingRepository), which indicates the use of Spring Data JPA to interact with the database. HTML/CSS/JavaScript:

For the frontend, HTML, CSS and JavaScript were probably used to create the user interface and visual representation of the pages. Thymeleaf:

Thymeleaf was probably used, since the controller returns template names (for example, "home", "login", "register"), which is typical for Thymeleaf, which allows you to create dynamic HTML pages. The database:

There is no explicit information about a specific database, but presumably some kind of relational database is used (for example, MySQL, PostgreSQL), which the application accesses via Spring Data JPA. Spring Boot:

Judging by the structure of the project, Spring Boot is probably used to automatically configure most components and create a self-sufficient application. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
